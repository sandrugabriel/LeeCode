Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.



Example 1:

Input: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: We have 3 students where:
The first student started doing homework at time 1 and finished at time 3 and wasn't doing anything at time 4.
The second student started doing homework at time 2 and finished at time 2 and also wasn't doing anything at time 4.
The third student started doing homework at time 3 and finished at time 7 and was the only student doing homework at time 4.
Example 2:

Input: startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 4

Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.

A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.



Example 1:

Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
Output: 4
Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.
Example 2:

Input: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"
Output: 2
Explanation: "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.
Example 3:

Input: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"
Output: -1

There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i]. Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop, considering the special discount.



Example 1:

Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation: 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.

Explanation: If you choose the indices i=1 and j=2 (indexed from 0), you will get the maximum value, that is, (nums[1]-1)*(nums[2]-1) = (4-1)*(5-1) = 3*4 = 12. 
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,5,4,5]
Output: 16
