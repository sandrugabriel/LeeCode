Return the latest valid time you can get from time by replacing the hidden digits.



Example 1:

Explanation: The latest hour beginning with the digit '2' is 23 and the latest minute ending with the digit '0' is 50.
Example 2:

Given a string s, return the longest substring of s that is nice. If there are multiple, return the substring of the earliest occurrence. If there are none, return an empty string.



Example 1:

Input: s = "YazaAay"
Output: "aAa"
Explanation: "aAa" is a nice string because 'A/a' is the only letter of the alphabet in s, and both 'A' and 'a' appear.
"aAa" is the longest nice substring.
Example 2:

Input: s = "Bb"
Output: "Bb"
Explanation: "Bb" is a nice string because both 'B' and 'b' appear. The whole string is a substring.
Example 3:

Input: s = "c"
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no nice substrings.*/

There may be duplicates in the original array.

Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length such that A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length], where % is the modulo operation.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 3 positions to begin on the the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make s alternating.



Example 1:

Input: s = "0100"
Output: 1
Explanation: If you change the last character to '1', s will be "0101", which is alternating.
Example 2:

Input: s = "10"

Explanation: s is already alternating.
Example 3:

Input: s = "1111"

Return the index (0-indexed) of the valid point with the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location. If there are multiple, return the valid point with the smallest index. If there are no valid points, return -1.

The Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2).



Example 1:

Input: x = 3, y = 4, points = [[1,2],[3,1],[2,4],[2,3],[4,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Of all the points, only [3,1], [2,4] and [4,4] are valid. Of the valid points, [2,4] and [4,4] have the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location, with a distance of 1. [2,4] has the smallest index, so return 2.
Example 2:

Input: x = 3, y = 4, points = [[3,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: The answer is allowed to be on the same location as your current location.
Example 3:
